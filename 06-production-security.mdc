# Production Security & Deployment

## Environment Validation

**Required environment variables for production:**
* Validate all required variables at application startup
* Ensure HTTPS origins only in ALLOWED_ORIGINS
* Verify BOOTSTRAP_SECRET is cryptographically secure (32+ characters)
* Confirm DISABLE_BOOTSTRAP=true in production
* Check DATABASE_URL includes SSL configuration

**Production configuration requirements:**
* Set NODE_ENV=production
* Enable rate limiting and security headers
* Configure secure cookies and HTTPS enforcement
* Set appropriate log levels and monitoring

## Container Security

**Docker security requirements:**
* Use specific Node.js version (not 'latest')
* Create and use non-root user
* Set security environment variables at build time
* Implement health checks for container monitoring
* Use minimal base images (alpine variants)

## Security Monitoring

**Security event logging:**
* Log authentication failures and authorization denials
* Monitor privileged endpoint access attempts
* Track rate limiting violations and suspicious patterns
* Implement different severity levels for events

**Production monitoring requirements:**
* Set up alerts for critical security events
* Monitor database query performance
* Track application health and uptime
* Implement security incident response procedures

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Automated security checks:**
* Validate environment variable configuration
* Verify bootstrap endpoint is disabled
* Check HTTPS-only origin configuration
* Confirm strong bootstrap secret generation

**Manual security verification:**
* Review security headers configuration
* Verify rate limiting is properly configured
* Test CORS origin restrictions
* Validate SSL/TLS certificate configuration

**Infrastructure security:**
* Use private subnets for application servers
* Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Implement DDoS protection measures
* Set up intrusion detection systems

**Database security:**
* Enable encryption at rest and in transit
* Configure database firewall rules
* Implement regular security patches
* Set up backup and disaster recovery

*Security is continuous: validate, monitor, and update regularly.*
